Online social networks nowadays serve as important service for connecting to friends and other people that we are interested to see content from. Research on big platforms like Facebook and Twitter shows that those services are frequently used for gathering additional information on a current topic besides the reporting of public news agencies and that this additional information can even have a higher influence on our final opinion on a topic than conventional news outlets do. According to xy et al. this effect is caused by 


Existing research states that the vast availability of similar-minded people in online social networks leads us to enclose ourselves in so-called echo chambers and to disconnect from people who are too different from us. This leads us to reinforce our opinion solely through finding others that think similar. If this reinforcement would continue, people would be separated into different camps quickly and would not be able to agree on each other anymore. As most people prefer to make compromises it is interesting to have a closer look on the thresholds which let them keep in touch with people who they don’t agree on and how a variation of these thresholds changes the overall picture. Therefore, we created an agent-based model that allows us to simulate the desired behaviors and to compare the resulting network structures.

- In social media it is very easy for users to take specific roles - from passive news consumer like the majority of social media users to others who use their networks for spreading their opinions

- Individuals with higher influence seem naturally more involved and active in spreading their opinions and discuss/interact with others - they act as opinion leaders (Schäfer et al. 2015)

- People who perceive themselves as opinion leaders also have higher intention to share news on social media 


## Role of social networks for opinion formation

- Besides sociocultural factors, also social network dynamics show an influence on the evolution of political opinions in multicultural social networks (Szymanski et al. 2016)

## Modelling opinion dynamics

After shedding light on the role of social media platforms on providing social ties and their importance for information and opinion spread it is also central for our research approach to understand, how opinion dynamics can be modelled. We therefore take a closer look on research that deals with the operationalization of opinion on the one hand and the modeling of social networks in simulation environments on the other hand.

It is necessary to transform the opinion of a social network member into a value that allows for transforming and comparing to others based on mathematical operations. Only this way we can implement mechanisms for the interaction and mutual influence of opinions inside the simulated network community.

- Initial idea of simulating opinion dynamics: measure what factors lead to consensus finding (DeGroot 1974). Therefore: Handling opinion as a concrete variable and weighting its influence depending on the importance of a certain agent

Agent-based simulation models regarding a bounded confidence approach were initially proposed by Deffuant et al. as they showed how a fixed threshold in which opinion change occurs alters the overall opinion distribution in a simulation. They chose to opinion is modelled on a one-dimensional, continuous scale from 0 to 1. Besides the condition that the agents talk to each other randomly and each conversation is considered for a possible opinion change, they also applied a network model for regulating communication partners within the agents. Using square lattices as underlying topology, the agents were restricted to only talking to four others directly adjacent to them. In comparison with a model that uses complete mixing of agents, the network version shows especially for low opinion thresholds that consensus is no longer found for a major group of agents but rather depends on the connectedness of agent clusters.

The research of Weisbuch et al. continues the evaluation of network influence on a bounded confidence model by comparing the original fully mixed mode of Deffuant et al. with a model that incorporates scale-free networks as limiting environments for the agent communication. They also found that a scale-free network structure does not have a radical influence on opinion dynamics. Most prominent, the use of scale-free networks lead to far more isolated agents and the role of the most-connected node provides useful information. It could be shown, that such supernodes were most influential compared to all other nodes and processed themselves also a significant opinion change during the clustering process. With decreasing density, differences to the standard mixed variant get more visible. Further motivation for investigating the effect of Barabási-Albert networks is given by the research of Stauffer et al. who also differentiated between directed and undirected networks. They discovered that especially for small epsilon < 0.4 for the bounded confidence intervals the opinions of the simulated agents show stronger deviations from each other. For epsilon > 0.4 their agents always end up with finding a consensus. Studies of Fortunato et al. show equal indications that for epsilon < 0.5 an opinion dynamics model based on the approach of Deffuant et al. always leads to the formation of a consensus independent from the underlying network structure.

Later on, Hegselmann and Krause extended the complexity of the bounded confidence approach by implementing dependencies on symmetry and individual agent properties for the confidence value. Looking on the continuous scale of opinions, the threshold for bounded confidence therewith can adapt to the actual position of an agent on this scale and the direction of potential consensus finding. Besides, agents can also hold now an individual confidence which allows for implementing different types of agent personalities.







To reproduce an online social network in a simulation we must rely on a network generator that is comparable to a real network. As social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are close to a scale-free network in their overall network structure and follow a powerlaw distribution, the Barabasi-Albert network generator is most suitable for generating a realistic network topology. Within a Barabasi-Albert network there exists a little amount of very well-connected hubs while most nodes have only few connections to others. The Barabasi-Albert generator provides several parameters like the initial network size, the number of new nodes that are added to an initial network and the number of edges which are created by the joining nodes to existing nodes using preferential attachment. This allows us to get the simulation close to a real social network structure.
