## Structure follows opinion or vice versa?
For the different settings we were able to detect cases where the structure of the network influenced the individual agent's opinion formation significantly and also cases where the opinion distribution has lead to a change of network structure.

Opinion follows structure: Unfriend Threshold (Below 0.6 leads always to consensus)

Structure follows Opinion: Addfriends mechanic (NoN Approach leads to more communities and disconnected components, also higher diversity of the communities)

Our research provides important insight for simulating online social networks. We were able to show that the examined parameters play an important role for modelling a realistic network. The Barabasi-Albert generator proved to be a solid basis for building such simulations. Nevertheless, it is important to compare it with other generators and to enrich simulations by including more functionality like adding and removing agents to the network and experimenting with different initial opinion distributions. We will continue our work on simulating opinion and network dynamics with Julia to be able to include more parameters and to enhance the accuracy of our simulations.

## Reasons to disconnect
Reasons for disconnecting from the network and staying disconnected for the rest of the simulation varied between the different configurations. While disconnected agents in networks with random or hybrid new friends picking would still be able to reconnect to others, agents who disconnected in the neighbors of neighbors setting were not able to reconnect. Complete disconnection of agents in the final state occured only in networks with an unfriend threshold of 0.4 and 0.8. It happened most often in simulations that used the neighbors of neighbors approach followed by the random approach and least often in simulations with hybrid approach of edge creation.
