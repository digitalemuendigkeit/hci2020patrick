# Discussion

Our work revealed several results that call for further investigation. Subsequently we will discuss the results in relation to other research and look into the lessons learned from our initial approach and possible further steps.

As could be shown, the overall model configuration was capable of simulating the opinion dynamics in a social network and suitable to perform experiments regarding specific factors of the network size and behavior. The programming language Julia prove robust as a simulation environment and provided all necessary flexibility to implement our approach as well as enough performance to run several configurations and repetitions in a reasonable time.

With changing the overall agent count in the network we wanted to observe how a higher availability of possible friends in a network and the strengthening of supernodes through the preferential attachment mechanism will change the structure and dynamics in the network. The obtained results indicate that through increasing the network size, the agents grow closer together although the overall network density decreases significantly. This counterintuitive result can be explained with the significant influence growth of the supernode in the network. We interpret the absent influence of network size on all measures of opinion dynamics except for the obviously higher deviation of opinions in larger networks as confirmation for the robustness of our implementation. 

Looking on the other two factors we were able to establish significant influences on both network and opinion dynamics. While the unfriend threshold depicts the effects of direct individual behavior of the agents, the addfriends mechanic can be seen as indirect individual behavior as a certain platform could provide recommendations for new friends in various ways and therewith lead the user to establish new connections more locally (through looking into neighbors of neighbors) or more globally (through looking randomly in the whole network). Being limited on the local environment naturally leads to lower network densities as the amount of agents who hold similar opinions decreases. As a consequence, the opinion deviation increases and so does the difference between the own opinion and the perceived public opinion. The higher delta of opinion change in networks with random or hybrid addfriends mechanics compared to the other mechanic can be reasoned with the effect of bounded confidence: if agents act in an environment that is closer to their own opinion, they will more likely approach to the opinions of the others and the higher density of networks with randomly chosen friends allows for more opinion fluctuation. The restriction to local neighbors on the other hand leads more often to local environments where the public perceived opinion is too distant from the own opinion and alternatively the backfire effect is triggered.

The unfriend threshold showed the diversest influence on the measured network and opinion dynamics. Inherently, the density of a network increases when its members are less rigorous with cutting unsuitable friendship ties. Also the effects on centrality and clustering of the network seem rather obvious and the decrease of opinion change delta orthogonal to the rise of distance between public and own opinion shows againg the incidence of the bounded confidence dynamics. More interesting, however, is the sharp change of measures for unfriend thresholds of 0.6 and 0.8. Previous research suggests that members of online social networks tend to unfriend other individuals due to offensive or counter-attitudinal posts but it shows simultaneously that a large share of users are rather lazy in cutting their weak ties [@John2015]. John et al. also found that cutting ties because of political posts happens more often around individuals who hold stronger political inclinations and with the reason to increase homogenity in their Facebook Newsfeeds. For less politically interested individuals the primary motivation in cutting those ties lay in reducing the amount of political posts in their feed.

With our initial approach we were able to target a proof of concept for an agent-based model that provides more closeness to reality through implementing certain dynamics of real-world social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Concurrently, our results motivate for further investigation of the examined factors and inclusion of further dynamics into the network model. Like other research showed it is difficult to set a limit on fitting the model to real-world dynamics as almost every effect that occurs can be implemented with more or less complexity into a certain simulation environment. Han et al. for example considered more precisely the personality of agents and focused specifically on the effect of adding "stubborn" agents to a simulation. For simulations with a higher share of agents who stick stubbornly to their opinion they found that the number of opinion clusters decreased [@Han2019]. 

As Dunbar et al. found we tend to interact on social media platforms within certain communicational layers [@Dunbar2015]. That means that our connections to other individuals hold similar connotations to those in the offline world and that we would differentiate our interactions with friends, colleagues and more distant acquaintances. For introducing such dynamics into simulation models Salehi et al. showed a first approach through varying additional trust levels for the friendship connections of the agents [@Salehi2016].


Possible extensions:

- Incorporation of a converged simulation state? How much change appears when simulation is continued after 1.000 steps? (Meng et al., 2018)

Stuff to think about:

- News consumption on Social Media platforms is connected to lower trusts in the consumed content compared to information/news websites (Ceron 2015)

- Extensive analysis of Facebook's social graph shows deviations from small-world properties --> motivation for looking for other approaches to model the network topology (Wilson 2009)


Outlook:

- Forecasting opinion dynamics (Valera et al. 2016)
