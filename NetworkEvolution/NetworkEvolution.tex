\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In the past decade the evolution of the internet and social media
platforms raised new forms of social networks that changed our
interpersonal communication and the methods of information procurement
considerably. It has become very easy to connect to existing friends
online, look for new friends and exchange information with them for
example using platforms like Facebook or Twitter. As the formation of an
individual's opinion is based on all available resources it is important
to understand how the information received in online social networks is
embedded into the process of opinion formation and how people behave in
such networks.

\hypertarget{theory}{%
\section{Theory}\label{theory}}

Existing research states that the vast availability of similar-minded
people in online social networks leads us to enclose ourselves in
so-called echo chambers and to disconnect from people who are too
different from us. This leads us to reinforce our opinion solely through
finding others that think similar. If this reinforcement would continue,
people would be separated into different camps quickly and would not be
able to agree on each other anymore. As most people prefer to make
compromises it is interesting to have a closer look on the thresholds
which let them keep in touch with people who they don't agree on and how
a variation of these thresholds changes the overall picture. Therefore,
we created an agent-based model that allows us to simulate the desired
behaviors and to compare the resulting network structures.

To reproduce an online social network in a simulation we must rely on a
network generator that is comparable to a real network. As social media
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are close to a scale-free network
in their overall network structure and follow a powerlaw distribution,
the Barabasi-Albert network generator is most suitable for generating a
realistic network topology. Within a Barabasi-Albert network there
exists a little amount of very well-connected hubs while most nodes have
only few connections to others. The Barabasi-Albert generator provides
several parameters like the initial network size, the number of new
nodes that are added to an initial network and the number of edges which
are created by the joining nodes to existing nodes using preferential
attachment. This allows us to get the simulation close to a real social
network structure.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

We chose the programming language Julia to conduct our research. With
the LightGraphs package, this language provides performant network
simulation and the required network generators for our agent-based
model. It is also possible to implement batch runs that are based on the
same random seed so that the network evolution following different
parameters can be analyzed subsequently.

In our research, we focused on the variation of limited parameters for
answering our research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Size of the network: How do network and opinion dynamics interplay
  with the size of a social network?
\item
  Adding friends: What is the difference between randomly making friends
  in the network and choosing only from the friends of existing friends?
\item
  Removing friends: How does the threshold for accepting opinion
  differences interfere with the overall opinion and network dynamics?
  The distribution of opinions throughout the agents was not varied, but
  uniformly distributed, because their variation would have blurred the
  effect of the examined parameters on the network evolution.
\end{itemize}

To analyze the effect of our parameters, we chose different approaches
of social network analysis and evaluated the resulting networks and
their nodes regarding their degree, centrality, communality, diameter,
and clustering coefficient.

\hypertarget{the-network-model}{%
\subsection{The Network Model}\label{the-network-model}}

We designed a network in which agents interact with each other through
publishing posts to their followers and receiving content through their
followees. The network is directed so that it is more suitable to
represent a real online social network as currently most of the famous
social networks allow for unidirectional relationships. The different
edges are considered as direction of information spread: outgoing edges
from agent x show to which agents the posts of agent x will be sent
while incoming edges show from which agents the agent x receives posts.
The initial network is created by using the Barabasi Albert Network
generator of the LightGraphs package in Julia. This generator allows to
define the size of the network and an initial average edge count per
agent that follows a power law distribution.

After creating the network, the agents are generated with the following
attributes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Opinion {[}-1,1{]}: Main attribute to change their network of incoming
  edges (followees). Initially, the opinion is uniformly distributed
  over all agents.
\item
  Perceived Public Opinion {[}-1,1{]}: The mean opinion a particular
  agent perceives in its neighborhood through seeing the posts of
  inneighbors. If the absolute distance between the public and its own
  opinion is in a defined threshold, the agent approaches towards the
  public opinion. If not, the agent will move into the opposite
  direction of the perceived opinion (therewith increasing the
  distance). If an agent ends up having no neighbors, the perceived
  public opinion mirrors its own opinion.
\item
  Inclination to Interact {[}0,Inf{]}: The willingness of agents to
  share posts. A distribution function sets 80\% of the agents to
  passive receivers who rarely share a post. Very few agents have a
  higher inclination to interact than 1 and share multiple posts per
  simulation step. After initial generation, this attribute is fixed.
\item
  Feed (Array of max. 15 posts): Storage of received posts. The feed of
  agent x contains all shared posts from agents who are inneighbors of
  agent x
\end{itemize}

The perceived public opinion is the only factor that has influence on an
agent's opinion and is driven by the posts that are visible to this
agent. The most important attributes of a post are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Opinion {[}-1,1{]}: A post's opinion is generated from the opinion of
  the agent who publishes it. Its opinion is randomly varied by applying
  a random addition between {[}-0.1,0.1{]}.
\item
  Weight: The weight of a post represents the publicity of an agent as
  it is the count of outneighbors of the posting agent. Posts with high
  weights are perceived as more important and influential through the
  receiving agents compared to posts that have been published from
  agents with low outdegree.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-simulation-architecture}{%
\subsection{The Simulation
Architecture}\label{the-simulation-architecture}}

A simulation consists of an initiating phase that creates the required
initial network and agents with their properties, a main simulation
phase where the agents interact and time steps are performed and a data
saving phase. Every simulation timestep follows the same order of
actions. First, the agent list is shuffled to ensure that the order in
which the agents perform their interactions don't have an impact on the
simulation outcomes. Following, the actions of a certain agent ina
simulation step are described:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Update the feed:} The posts that were received in the previous
  step get sorted by their weight and the weight of all posts in the
  feed are reduced by the factor 0.5 to provide higher visibility to
  newer posts. The feed is limited to the 15 highest-weighted posts, all
  other posts are dropped and not further considered for calculation of
  the perceived public opinion.
\item
  \emph{Update perceived public opinion:} The updated feed is used to
  calculate the perceived public opinion. The opinion of posts with
  higher weights have a higher influence in calculation. If the feed of
  the agent is empty, the perceived public opinion mirrors the opinion
  of the agent.
\item
  \emph{Update the opinion:} With the perceived public opinion an agent
  now updates its own opinion. If the absolute distance between public
  opinion and own opinion is inside a defined threshold, the agent
  approaches towards the public opinion by a factor of 0.05. If the
  absolute distance lies outside the range, the agent moves into the
  opposing direction and therewith increases the distance what we call
  the \enquote{backfire effect}.
\item
  \emph{Drop ingoing edges:} With regarding its updated opinion, an
  agent checks if the current posts in his feed are in an accepted
  absolute distance to the own opinion. If not, the agent also checks
  the real opinion of the source agent and if this opinion is also
  outside the accepted range, the agent drops the incoming edge so that
  it won't receive further posts of the former followee. In one step, an
  agent can only drop a tenth of his current number (rounded up) of
  ingoing edges so that a realistic behavior is maintained.
\item
  \emph{Add ingoing edges:} After disconnecting from agents that are
  outside of the accepted opinion range, an agent adds new ingoing edges
  if his inneighbors count is below a desired value. All agents try to
  maintain an indegree that equals a tenth of the network size.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

Our simulation study comprised in total 18 simulation runs that show the
impact and relationships of the varied factors on the network evolution
and opinion dynamics.

\hypertarget{final-state}{%
\subsection{Final state}\label{final-state}}

What can be learned from the simulation state after 1000 steps? Which
factors have significant direct/indirect influence on degree
distribution, centrality of nodes, cluster coefficient, and opinion
distribution?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Threshold of annoyance shows direct influence on edgecount: With a
  higher threshold for differing opinions, edge count decreases (effect
  is stronger for smaller network sizes)
\item
  Agents can get isolated for certain reasons that depend on the
  addfriends method: in random selection, radicalized agents have a
  higher probability to get isolated as they won't add new friends if
  all other agents' opinions are too far away. In Neighbors of
  neighbors, agents who disconnect from their last neighbor have no
  chance to get back into the network.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{impact-of-the-network-factors-on-opinion-spread}{%
\subsection{Impact of the network factors on opinion
spread}\label{impact-of-the-network-factors-on-opinion-spread}}

Most significant impact: Unfriend threshold

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With lower tolerance of differing opinions the agents become more
  consensual (on lowest level = 0.4, final opinion distribution has std
  of 0.31). This effect increases with settings that use random or
  hybrid picking of new friends to SD \textless= 0.08
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evolution-process}{%
\subsection{Evolution Process}\label{evolution-process}}

How does the network change during the simulation? Split-ups into
multi-components, how fast does it recover? Do hubs vary over time? What
influence has the opinion distribution on the network?

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our research provides important insight for simulating online social
networks. We were able to show that the examined parameters play an
important role for modelling a realistic network. The Barabasi-Albert
generator proved to be a solid basis for building such simulations.
Nevertheless, it is important to compare it with other generators and to
enrich simulations by including more functionality like adding and
removing agents to the network and experimenting with different initial
opinion distributions. We will continue our work on simulating opinion
and network dynamics with Julia to be able to include more parameters
and to enhance the accuracy of our simulations.
